//! Video recording of a chosen application window (Windows only for now).
//!
//! Mirrors the shape of the [`crate::audio`] module: a cfg-gated `platform`
//! backend behind a small public API used by the session lifecycle and the
//! `list_windows` / `set_video_options` commands. On Windows the backend uses the
//! `windows-capture` crate (Windows.Graphics.Capture + a Media Foundation
//! H.264/AAC encoder) and captures its own 48 kHz/stereo audio (mic + system),
//! independent of the 16 kHz Deepgram path. Other platforms compile but report
//! the feature unsupported, and the UI hides the controls there.
