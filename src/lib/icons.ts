/**
 * Central icon vocabulary for the app, backed by the free Hugeicons set
 * (`@hugeicons/core-free-icons`). Components render these with the
 * `<HugeiconsIcon>` wrapper from `@hugeicons/react`:
 *
 *   import { HugeiconsIcon } from '@hugeicons/react';
 *   import { IconClose } from '../lib/icons';
 *   <HugeiconsIcon icon={IconClose} size={16} strokeWidth={2} />
 *
 * Icons inherit the surrounding text color via `currentColor` (the wrapper's
 * default), so existing Tailwind color classes keep working. Keeping the
 * mapping here means the whole icon set can be swapped from one place.
